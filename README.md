## Overview

### Built with

- express generator
- express-jwt
- express-openid-connect
- auth0

### What I learned

- fetch is coming to node

- With Axios you don't have to convert the response to json manually.  

### Continued development

- Look more into monorepos - nx and turborepo 
- api folder needs dotenv as well - safe to expose tenant name?
